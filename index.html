                        <p class="lead">Reflection</p>
                        <p>Calling Christ the Savior brings me a lot of peace. I know that I fall short in so many ways every single day, and I know that there is no way I could ever come close to qualifying to live with my Heavenly Father on my own. Knowing that Jesus Christ sacrificed Himself so that I can return to Him means more than I can explain. He did not have to do it, so knowing that Jesus went through all that suffering for me makes me feel so loved. As I learn more and more about the Atonement of Christ, I am filled with even more gratitude that He is my Savior. In a world so full of darkness and despair, having a Savior offers hope that you cannot find anywhere else.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Reflection</p>
                        <p>The quote I included by Elder Uchtdorf is one of my all-time favorites. I love thinking of Christ as my Creator because it portrays a deep connection with Jesus and I. For me, whenever I create something, I tend to take special care of it and put extra effort into making sure it is successful. It is really cool to think of Christ as having that kind of connection with me. He wants me to be successful and He loves me so deeply, and knowing that fills me with hope. Additionally, the name "Creator" denotes that He is all-knowing and all-powerful. How incredible is it that an all-powerful being is watching over me and cares so much about me? To me, this is one of the most mind-blowing concepts.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Reflection</p>
                        <p>I remember studying about shepherds while reading the New Testament. I was surprised to hear about how much effort a shepherd puts into taking care of his sheep. A shepherd knows each sheep individually, puts countless hours into taking care of his sheep, and even sleeps at the gate to protect the sheep from anything harmful that could come throughout the night. This comparision with Jesus Christ made me better realize the depth of His love for me. He has given me everything and cares about me so much, and I am so grateful for Him and for the mercy and love He shows me. I know that I can turn to Him with all my needs, and He will never turn me away.</p>
